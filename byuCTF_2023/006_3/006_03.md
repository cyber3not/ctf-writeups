>We've finally got a foothold in Janus' network, and we're ready to take them down. This time we've recovered a small batch of passwords that seem to belong to various henchmen in his organisation. We'll need all of them cracked so we can do as much damage as possible this time around. Are you up to the task?

>Flag format - byuctf{password1_password2_password3_password4}

This time we were given the following 4 hashes:

```

Then let's see what comes out when we pass the 4 hashes [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/).

We see that two passwords could be found.
However, we need all 4 to be able to create the complete flag.

It is interesting that we can see a pattern here!
Both found passwords start with the same word `goldeneye` and end with three numbers.

I took the word `goldeneye` and put it into a file `custom.txt`.

With Hashcat i want to go through all combinations of __goldeneye__ + __3 numbers__.

For this we use a `hybrid attack` through the switch `-a` with the mode number `6`.

Since we want to append three digits in combination with the password we have to add `?d?d?d` to our command.

And for __sha512__ hashes we use `-m 1700`.

The final command `hashcat -m 1700 006_3.txt custom.txt -a 6 ?d?d?d` cracked all 4 passwords and I could submit the flag.

Flag: `byuctf{goldeneye007_goldeneye641_goldeneye069_goldeneye159}`
