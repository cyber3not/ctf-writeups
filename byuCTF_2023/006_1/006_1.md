>In this James Bond themed CTF challenge, you're tasked with cracking the password of Janus, and evil crime lord, to access his encrypted files containing crucial information about the organization's plans for a devastating attack. Time is of the essence, and the fate of millions rests on your ability to crack the password and stop the impending disaster.

We were given the following hash:

`fb77dc5534f88d45fa2985d92a68c60c`

I found the password quickly via an online [crack service](https://crackstation.net/).
